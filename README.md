## 🌍 About the Project

Tree Health Monitoring is a gamified community initiative designed to make tree plantation and care an engaging and rewarding experience. Leveraging cutting-edge AI and Blockchain technologies, we aim to reconnect the younger generation with nature and promote environmental sustainability.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

In urban and semi-urban areas of Delhi, the responsibility of planting and caring for trees often falls solely on the government and NGOs. Our research highlights key issues:

- Lack of motivation, time, and space due to busy lifestyles
- Limited connection with environmental organizations
- Absence of community events and regular meetups
- No system for tree health monitoring or recognition for environmental contributions

## 🌱 Impact

We envision crushed numbers in terms of:

- Increased community participation
- Improved tree health monitoring
- Reduction in barren lands through reforestation

## 💡 Solution Approach

Our solution focuses on a global, community-driven initiative:

- **Gamification:** Inspired by Pokemon GO, users earn rewards for activities like planting, watering, and pest detection.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Activities are tracked and rewarded with tokens redeemable for forest produce.
- **AI & GIS:** AI models for tree health monitoring and GIS for identifying plantable areas.
- **Green Library:** Exchange old books for plants to promote green living.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Flutter
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** Postregs
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Smart Contracts
- **AI/ML:** Pytorch, OpenCV
- **GIS:** Satellite Imagery APIs
