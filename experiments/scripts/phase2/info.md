# Tree plantation detection 

## Datasets for Training and Fine-Tuning
1. Tree Detection Datasets

   - NeonTreeEvaluation: A benchmark dataset with bounding box annotations for individual trees in RGB, LiDAR, and hyperspectral imagery. It covers diverse forest types and is ideal for training tree detection models 14.

   - IDtrees NIST NEON: Provides labeled trees with RGB, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data, suitable for multi-modal fusion 2.

   -  ReforesTree: Focuses on tropical forests and includes individual tree locations, species, and biomass data, useful for fine-tuning models in specific environments 


c. Example Datasets

    GitHub - Vaibhav-Pant/Object_Detection_YOLO: A project using YOLOv5s to detect trees from aerial images, with a dataset prepared using Google Earth Pro 2.

    Tree Detection from Satellite Images: A GitHub project using YOLOv5 and Roboflow to detect trees from satellite images, with annotations for overlapping trees and shadows 


## Challenges and Solutions
a. Challenges

    Overlapping Trees: In dense forests, overlapping tree crowns can lead to missed detections 7.

    Background Complexity: Similar colors between trees and the background can cause false positives 1.

    Lighting and Shadows: Variations in lighting can affect detection accuracy

b. Solutions

    Data Augmentation: Techniques like mosaic augmentation and StyleGAN can improve model robustness by generating diverse training samples 59.

    Attention Mechanisms: Modules like Coordinate Attention (CA) can enhance feature extraction, improving detection in complex backgrounds 5.

    Multi-Scale Detection: Using feature pyramids (e.g., PANet) helps detect trees of varying sizes and densities


## Future Enhancements

- Community Validation: Allow other users to verify tree plantings through voting or additional evidence (e.g., multiple images from different angles).

- Carbon Credit Integration: Partner with organizations to convert validated tree plantings into carbon credits, adding a financial incentive for users.
